You are given an array arr of length N. You have to return a list of integers containing the NGE(next greater element) of each element of the given array.
The NGE for an element X is the first greater element on the right side of X in the array. 
Elements for which no greater element exists, consider the NGE as -1.
Input-
1
4
9 3 6 5

Output-
-1 6 -1 -1


Explanation For Sample Input :
For element 9, there is no next greater element. So -1 would be the next greater element.
For element 3, 6 is the next greater element. 
For element 6, there is no next greater element. So -1 would be the next greater element.
For element 5, there is no next greater element. So -1 would be the next greater element.
